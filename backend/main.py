    ⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY:
    1. ONLY evaluate topics and skills that were ACTUALLY DISCUSSED in the transcript above
    2. DO NOT mention or score ANY topic that was not explicitly covered in the conversation
    3. DO NOT assume knowledge or skills - only assess what the candidate actually demonstrated
    4. If a topic wasn't discussed, DO NOT include it in strengths, weaknesses, or recommendations
    5. Quote specific responses from the transcript to justify your scores
    6. If the interview was short or limited in scope, reflect that honestly in your assessment
    7. Compare the "Topics from Resume" list with the actual transcript to identify what was NOT covered
    
    SCORING GUIDELINES (be honest and specific):
    - 1-3: Poor (wrong answers, fundamental misunderstandings, couldn't answer)
    - 4-5: Below Average (partial knowledge, struggled to explain, major gaps)
    - 6-7: Average (correct but basic answers, could go deeper)
    - 8-9: Good (strong understanding, clear explanations, good examples)
    - 10: Excellent (exceptional depth, went above and beyond)

    - [Topic 1]: [Brief assessment based on actual response]
    - [Topic 2]: [Brief assessment based on actual response]
    (Only include topics from the actual conversation)
    
    ### Technical Assessment
    - Demonstrated Proficiency: (Junior/Mid/Senior - based ONLY on actual answers)
    - Strengths Shown: (2-3 specific examples with quotes from transcript)
    - Weaknesses Identified: (2-3 specific gaps shown in actual responses)
    {coding_section}
    
    ### Communication Quality
    - Clarity: [1-10]/10 (How clearly did they explain in their actual responses?)
    - Depth of Answers: [1-10]/10 (Did they provide detailed or superficial answers?)
    - Technical Vocabulary: [1-10]/10 (Did they use correct terminology?)
    
    ### Key Quotes from Interview
    Include 2-3 notable quotes (good or bad) from the candidate's actual responses.
    
    ### Recommendations for Improvement
    (Base these ONLY on weaknesses actually observed in the interview)
    1. [Specific recommendation based on actual gap shown]
    2. [Specific recommendation based on actual gap shown]
    
    ### Topics NOT Covered (From Resume)
    Compare the "Topics from Resume" list above with what was actually discussed.
    List any resume topics that were NOT discussed during the interview as "Not Assessed":
